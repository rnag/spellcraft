# PySpellCraft

`spellcraft` is a helper library with useful spells, primarily used by the [Dataclass Wizard].

This library exists to provide case conversion between common cases like
CamelCase and snake_case. It is intended to be unicode aware, internally
consistent, and reasonably well performing.
