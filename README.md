# PySpellCraft

`spellcraft` is a helper library that contains useful functions and "spells," primarily designed for use with [Dataclass Wizard].

This library exists to provide case conversion between common cases like
CamelCase and snake_case. It is intended to be unicode aware, internally
consistent, and reasonably well performing.
